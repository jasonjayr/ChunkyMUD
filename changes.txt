Changes starting with 0.06:
---------------------------
- Removal of '::main' from everywhere in the code.
- New help system is in.
- Centralized most of the movement code into move_player() in commands.pl
  and cleaned up the north(), south(), east(), etc., movement command code.
- Coded following accessor methods:
  State(), StateArgs(). Room(), Name(), Brief(), Autoexit(), Refresh()
- Tons of code cleanups.
- Updated finish_init_player() so it utilizes the new accessor methods.
- Finally got 'talk' working again after all the cleanups.
- Updated start_init_player() so it utilizes accessor methods.
- Wrote Timer.pm - works fine, kinda neat. Kinda a kludge. But it works!
  Now we just need psuedo-lag..
- ChunkyMUD-specific QueryHelp mod to do convert_to_inet() on help topics
  while loading them instead of on-the-fly.

Changes for 0.07:
-----------------
- Cleaned up a bit more of the code, addition of format_name() to misc.pl
  which does ucfirst(lc($name)) ..
- Fixed the register users code.
- Addition of Password.pm and getFile()
- Severe cleaning up of the code. Player.pm now exists, and has gained
  quite a bit in size.
- New xnames-loading code.
- New login registration code.
- Fixed up state-table logic in handle().
- Phased out several methods that were useless.
- Bugfix in Password::validate().
- Double-logins bug is finally squashed.
- Fixed some problems with the Player.pm accessor methods.
- New helpfiles.
- World code is decent for now. Built about 10 rooms.
- Fixed up the comand code.
- Interface enhancements - when you move from room to room it sends out
  messages stating that you've moved..

Changes for 0.07r1:
-------------------
- Bugfix in 'tell'.
- New 'welcome' message.
- Cleaned up directory structure.
- Experimental changes to the code that processes player commands..
- Bugfix with the 'quit' memory leak.
- Smarter return values for Player::Room().
- Bugfix in command-processing code.
- Slight change in the 'say' command.
- Better sanity-checking + bugfix in the registration code.
- Bit of a tweak in the 'help' command.
- Coded 'passwd' command.
- Minor cleanups in Password.pm
- Began coding 'playerfile loading/saving' code.
- Completely phased out the unused 'refresh' code.
- Another bugfix in the 'help' command.
- Addition of 'sdebug' as one of the debugging commands.
- Bugfixes in 'brief' and 'autoexit'.
- Playerfile loading/saving code declared functional! :-)

Changes for v0.07r2:
--------------------
- Player::Gender() method. Gender-entering spot in the registration code.
  It appears to be working, as well.
- Added damroll() to misc.pl
- Changed the Player::Room() method to Curroom(), so that it is
  more consistent with Curzone(), and the new playerfile load/save code.
- Changed all the method calls in the code from Room to Curroom().
- Bugfix in 'exits'.
- Cleaning done in several subroutines:
  Player::StateArgs(), Player::finish_init_player(), Player::remove(),
  comm.pl::close_connect().
- Refixed the double-logins bug. By cleaning finish_init_player(), I broke
  some code.
- Minor changes in getPlayersInRoom() and getClientsInRoom().
- Bugfix in save_player() so that a bad login no longer crashes the MUD.
- Did a similar 'fix' in load_player() though I am not sure a bug exists.
- Two tiny bugfixes in Password.pm
- Addition of uptime() from mystik. I hacked this apart to display a nicer
  uptime, and with his help, (I'm not good at time calculations. It hurts
  my brain ;-) added a seconds display. 
- 'score' command.

Changes for v0.07r3:
--------------------
- Socials code is in. Now we just need actual socials.
- Updated all the command-subroutine names so they are prefixed with 'c_'.
- Fixed messages for talk.
- Updated 'who' command.
- Added 'emote' command.
- Fixes in all the communication subroutines in comm.pl.
- 'tell' now works when people are in different rooms
- New Player.pm methods: Title() and getNamestr()
- Bugfix with the 'brief' command.
- A few teensy minor updates in the 'Confex FunHoUSe'.
- Updates in move_player().
- Illusionary walls!
- Fixed Timer.pm
- The new 'dispatch table' code is in. This makes it much, much easier
to add new state handlers.

Changes for v0.07r4 (internal):
-------------------------------
- Various updates to Timer.pm
- format_name() moved to Player.pm.
- Added World.pm as a cleaner, more organized interface to the World data:
  moved display_exits() and expandExit() there, new default-port
  code.
- nonblock() moved to comm.pl, since it is communications-related.
- Eliminated db.pl
- Misc code cleanups
- Wrote new command-processing code with 'abbrev' functionality.
- Finished up abbrev code: Player->Abbrev() method, display changes in
  'score' and 'sdebug'.
- Wrote new zone code:
  - Updated all the methods in World.pm 
  - Coded new methods in World.pm to be used as wrappers for setting
    up zone/room data (room titles, descs, exits.. etc). These are all
    prefixed with 'z_' in their method name.
- Updated Player->Curroom(), getClientsInRoom(), and getPlayersInRoom().
- Updated the communication routines to work with the new zone code.
- Updated cleanup_rooms() for the new zone code.
- Fixes to the communication commands (talk, whisper, etc.) so that you
  cannot talk/whisper/etc with someone whose not in the same zone/room as
  you, instead of just room.
- Smarter 'who' code.
- Addition of ' and , as aliases to 'say' and 'emote'.
- Bugfix in title code.
- Started a new zone - Village of the Camel
- New zone-loading code in World->load_world().
- 'hard links' code is in.
- Added getPlayersInZone() and getClientsInZone().
- Wrote the 'where' command.
- Added 2 new communication routines, (send_to_zone() and send_to_zone_except())
  and fixed send_to_room(). Also made minor changes to most of the comm.
  routines *again*. Someday they'll be perfect, till then, they bite.
- Rewrote the 'shout' command.
- *MAJOR* revamp of a huge portion of subroutine parameters. example:
  send_to_room_except() required FIVE arguments to operate - a clientfrom,
  clientto, curzone, curroom, and message. Now it requires 3 - curzone/
  curroom have been removed and are snatched up using $player->Curzone(
  $clientto), and so forth.
- Quick rendition of the 'listzone' command.

Changes in v0.07r5 (internal):
------------------------------
- Finally started making use of the timer code. Check out timers.pl.
  Timer subroutines start with 't_'.
- Playerfile-saving queue code is in, and uses timers (obviously).
  It saves one player every 60 seconds.
- Addition of defines.pl - subroutines are used as global constants
  now!
- Player entries in Player.pm objects are now tied to Tie::RefHash
  so we can use references as keys.
- Lag-out code added, Player->presence() method, plus lagout timer,
  and entry in defines.pl.
- Coded the 'amoo' social.
- Addition of the 'utils' dir, and the 'codegen.pl' script for generating
  a sorted list of subroutines from a bunch of code files. Also, added
  the 'docs' dir which will contain all the documentation.
- Data for the 'listzone' command is now generated at boot-time.
- Cleanups and bugfixes all over the place:
  - Eliminated start_init_player(). Changed finish_init_player() to 
    init_player().
  - Fixed it up so that the command prompt now displays when a player first
    logs on, not after he has typed his first command.
  - Password.pm has been updated so it's routines all give a return value.
  - Fixed a memory leak in Player->remove(). It didn't remove players from
    a Player object properly.
  - Updated the uptime() routine so it now does proper pluralization.
  - Minor fix in init.pl: load_xnames().
  - Tweak in getFile().
  - Quick audit of a large portion of the code, fixing many minor things
    with the code (not bugs, just things I didn't like ;-)
    
Changes in v0.07r7:
-------------------
- Started coding objects:
  - Objects now display in rooms they are located in.
  - You may now 'look' at objects.
  - Added 'REUSE' array for objects, wrote objDestroy(), and
  - rewrote objCreate() to take advantage of the REUSE array.
  - Added 'tap' and 'sacrifice' commands.
  - Wrote the 'get', 'drop', and 'inventory' commands. They don't work right
    at this point, unfortuneately.
- Bugfixes/cleanups this release:
  - Bugfix in c_help().
  - c_tell(), c_whisper(), and c_talk() now lc() the name passed to them.
  - Phased out sendmsg() and color.pl - What was I thinking?
  - Slight tweak in st_command().
- Added:
  - Routines for the creation and setting of room data now contain sanity-
    checking code.
  - Command-line parsing code plus some basic options.
  - parseString() as a simple template processor, and the 'welcome'
    file now uses the VERSION constant.

(note the new ChangeLog format)
4/6/2001 
    - Additions to the code:
      - copyHash() routine to misc.pl (World->objClone() now uses it)
      - 'drop' command
      - Repeat Last Command (!) command.
      - 'gameinfo' command, for fun.
    - Fixes:
      - 'get', 'inventory' commands
      - command-line processing code that was added on the earlier changes
        to v0.07r6
      - Little fix on errormsg handling for QueryHelp->get(), more changes
        to c_help() to accomodate it.
      - Threw hacks in World->objInfo() and World->getObjectsInRoom() to prevent
        silly memory leaks whenever a player moves into a room with an object.
      - Three really stupid bugs:
        - 'drop' wasn't working right.
        - Player->manipInventory() had bugs in the code that deletes objects
          from player Inventories, and also in the code that searches through
          player inventories for particular objects...
      - Two bugs - one each in c_talk() and c_whisper()...
      - Another bug in manipInventory().
      - Bugfix in c_inventory().
    - Most of the world-loading routines now use logit() instead
      of warn statements, to nag about their errors.
    - Rearranged output of 'time'.
    - Some code-cleanups in various commands..
    - Eliminated $c_fields from the @commands structure.
    - %xnames is now stored inside a World object, and accessed using the
      xname() method.. 
    - New utility script: coc.pl ... Quick-n-dirty code counter.
    - Added Data::Dumper as an optional module to use, to ease some of the debugging
      process.. Also added World->Debug().
    - Bugfix for the memory leak problems that World->getObjectsInRoom() was causing..
    - Began using a cheesy task-management system.. see tasks.txt
    - Fixed task #9.
    - Completed tasks 1 and 2.
    - Shifted some code around in st_command() so that socials are checked first, before regular commands..
      Sadly, I resorted to using a goto :-(

Changes in v0.07r8:
-------------------
4/9/01: 
		- Cleaned up some of the directory structure. While looking over the
			venerable v0.01 code, I accidentally merged the trees... Oh well. No code
			was lost..
		- Forgot to mention that I've begun work on simplifying Config::Ini into
			a smaller, easier-to-use module.. The code is in lib/Heavy_Devel/..
		- Fixed 'who' - when on alone it displays 0 instead of your name, the latter being the current + correct behavior.
		- Fixed problem with sending "Player leaves some-exit" messages to everyone but the player who is in the current room..
		- Tweaks in:
			- t_lagout()
			- t_pfile_queue()
			- Player->get_client()
			- close_connect()
			- Player->new(). Fixed a slight memory leak.
			- st_waitpw(), st_register()
		- Cleanups in:
			- Timer->poll_events() - Removal of commented-out code, etc.
			- st_command() - Removed $verbprocessed, simplified the while loop
		- Removed the repeat-last-command code.. My braindead design was causing 
			major memory leak problems. It will reappear at another time, when I am
			am ready for it.
		- Fixed another memory leak, this time in display_prompt().. Involved the 
			call in handle()..
		- Added a hack with st_command() and the call that uses it in handle()...
			Basically it prevents the above memory leak from occuring.
		- Minor cleanups, and fixes in st_register() so that only word characters 
			are allowed in usernames when they are being registered.
		- Began laying some of the roots that will become the trunk that is the
			v0.07 code tree:
			- Enhanced load_commands() so it has 2 fields per record, and integrates socials
				into the mix with regular commands.. Also has the beginnings of wizard commands..
			- Moved commands.pl and socials.pl into a new commands/ dir underneath lib/..
4/10/01:
			- Midnight recently came, so now I'm been working on the code over 2 separate days ;-)
			- Modifications to chunky.pl's set of "require" statements.. New wizards.pl file, which
				I am guessing will contain wizard commands code, and other miscellaneous
				wizard code that does not fit in the Player.pm module..
			- Phased out load_socials() and updated init() so it no longer calls it.
			- Imported code submitted by Scott McCurry (ctssam@cts.com).. They handle the following:
				- TELNET echo (So that when you type your password, it does not display !
			  - Backspace-handling !
					Thanks a ton, Scott! This code is GREATLY APPRECIATED!

Changes in v0.07r9:
-------------------
4/10/01:
 		 - st_register() was cleaned up a little bit, and also 
	   - st_waitpw()'s messages were tweaked slightly
		 - Addition of World->objEffects(), "NOTAKE" effect signifying that objects cannot be picked up,
			 and code in 'get' that makes use of it. 
		 - Stupid problem in move_player(). Fixed now.
		 - Fixed some bugs in the registration process.
		 - Added "num.objkeyword" code to 'get', 'drop', 'give', and 'tap'.
		 - tweaks in 'who', 'where'.. bugfix in 'where'.
		 - Finished INI manipulation module to lib/INI/Manip.pm, regression 
			 testing script..
		 - Fixed up coc.pl ;-) Now works off of 'wc'.
4/21/01:
		 - Added a fix for the code that calls HandleIAC() in chunky.pl, and
			 in HandleIAC() in lib/comm.pl... $data is now reset, so that HandleIAC()
			 is not unneedlessly called if the user is entering no data. This is 
			 a necessary fix.
		 - Updated QueryHelp and Timer modules to use the new ones.
