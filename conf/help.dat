.starthelp:communication
		COMMUNICATION Commands
		----------------------
	Commands involved with communication offer forms of, well,
communication, with other players. This includes sending both public
and private messages.

* say message
	- Sends: Bob says, 'message'. to everyone in the room.
* whisper person message
	- Sends: Bob whispers something to person, to everyone but you
	and the receiving person. Sends Bob whispers to you, 'message'.
	to you. To Bob, it sends You whisper to person, 'message'.
* tell person message
	- Similar to above but involves telepathing.
* shout message
	- Sends You shout, 'message'. to you. Sends 'Bob shouts, 'message'.'
	to everyone else.
* talk person message
	- You say to person, 'message'.  <-- player
	- Bob says to person, 'message'. <-- everyone else
	- Bob says to you, 'message'.	 <-- person

forth.

	Design notes are a work in progress, as is the design of this

.starthelp:__design

	ChunkyMUD Design: (as of v0.07)
	-----------------

	v0.07 is the buzzword-compliant 'bleeding-edge' version 
of ChunkyMUD. Originally started sometime before December 24, 2000 (The
earliest date I have written in comments in the code). Between December
22, I think, and the 27th, a lot of work was also accomplished.

	The original design was very, very rough. I didn't know anywhere
near as much about Perl as I do now. And my current knowledge still pales
in comparison to many ;-). Regardless, it had lots more global variables,
and much dirtier code than it does now. It used psuedo-OO which consisted
of some global hashes with nested data structures, and accessor methods.

	The coding and refining of QueryHelp, which is the help system by
myself that is driving this document right now, jumpstarted my Perl OO experience. That, combined with constant work on Perl OO modules at the fantastic company Confex, helped my ideas on software design much. While I admit the current design is not perfect, it is a work in progress, and is progressively getting cleaner.

	ChunkyMUD started with myself toying around with the non-forking
server example in the Perl Cookbook. It's the easiest way of creating
a server that can communicate messages between it's clients.

	The code benefits, of course, by some modules I've written to 
keep some of the code that doesn't really need to be seen, or out in the
open, hidden. QueryHelp is a really robust help system designed with 
multi-client servers such as MUDs, mail servers (sendmail, were it written
in Perl, could easily use QueryHelp to provide it with a help system) in
mind. In it's initial version (I suppose QueryHelp revision 1) it was located
as some non-reusable code in 'tmaild', a tiny mail daemon, that I wrote as 
a fun experiment in Perl. In it's second revision, which was around ChunkyMUD
v0.04 I believe, it was slightly better designed.

	My OO knowledge around that time was still lacking, however.
QueryHelp revision 2 loaded all the help topics in in advance. In tmaild,
it didn't. Bad. Very bad. 

	The current version of QueryHelp is v1.2, aka 'Revision 3'. The
ChunkyMUD QueryHelp is very slightly modified, I believe I added one line.
It is full OO, of course. 
.endhelp

.starthelp:rough
	A short list of rough points in the system:

	- Pretty much everything.
	- TELNET handling: MUD clients such as Ewan and Mudmaster send
	telnet garbage upon connecting. At the moment, this is simply
	stripped out.
.endhelp

.starthelp:going

	... Where this project is going ...

	I'm a huge advocate of MUDs. They rock. Like commercial RPG's such
as AD&D (the table game, not computer AD&D games such as Baldur's Gate) they
allow you to escape reality. In good measure, that's fantastic!

	And of course, administering, designing, or creating (very different
things!) allows you to play the part of unholy lord and Master of your
Universe. Most MUD administrators do what they do because of the feeling they
get from seeing their Universe succeed.

	However, ChunkyMUD does not aim to create it's own individualistic
universe. While it may see occasional spurts of playtesting by the author
in private groups, say, on lunch breaks at Confex, it will most likely not
be used by him to create his own customized universe.

	Mostly my focus is to mold it into a relatively stable and nice
template MUD in Perl. I do not have the time to devote to it to be able to label it a 'production MUD', in which the code is robust and high-performance.

	I would love for it to become the DikuMUD of Perl MUDs. There are
only about 4 Perl MUDs I know about right now - PerlMUD by Boutell,
lsmud (not recommended), Northlands MUD, and ChunkyMUD. PerlMUD resembles
TinyMUD, Northlands MUD appears to be taking the course of a customized
MUD, and ChunkyMUD, well.. Who knows. 

	If you have comments, or would like to help, let me know.

.starthelp:todos
	- Cleaner internals, of course.
	- World module that turns the global %World hash into an object,
	encapsulating various areas of it with methods the same way that
	all the Player-related crap was beaten into submission with
	Player.pm
	- Typical MUD abbrev code. Text::Abbrev is *NOT* what we want.

	Interested in helping? Can you code in Perl? 
	tarael200@aol.com wants YOU!

.starthelp:navigation
		Navigation
		----------
	This help index contains commands for navigating the world around
you. Lacking a better place to put certain things, some other 
related commands are in here:

* north, south, east, west, up, down - All movement commands move in the
	appropriate direction if that exit is available.
* brief - If enabled, then you will not see room descriptions when you 
	type look, or when you enter a room. If disabled, you will.
	By default it is disabled.
* autoexit - If enabled (by default it is) then you will see exits upon
	entering a room, or typing look. If disabled, you will not.
* look - Sends the room title, room description if brief is disabled,
	exits if autoexit is enabled, and players currently in the room,
	to the player.
.endhelp

.starthelp:miscellaneous
		Miscellaneous Commands
		----------------------

'who'		- List of everyone currently connected to the MUD.
		  This may contain inaccuracies, if say, someone drops
		  their connection.
'exits'		- Displays all the exits for a particular room.
