  List of Contributors
  --------------------
  (knowingly or unknowingly)

  - The person who did the wonderful obfuscation that displays the
    Camel in ASCII art. I borrowed this for the 'goodbye' message. Thank you,
    and tell me your name if you read this, so that I might update this file!
  - Aaron Sokoloski (AaronCheez on AIM), Mike Lambert (mongomike1 on AIM)
    for answering some miscellaneous questions I had.
  - mystik for the 'uptime' code (well, mostly for his sample calculations
    since I hacked the rest of it apart.)
  - The "Invincible Desert Dragon Sword Goddess" for inspiring me to code the
    'amoo' social.
  
  -------------------------------------
  ChunkyMUD Code Formatting Conventions
  -------------------------------------

  - 2-column indent on code.
  - No space before semicolon.
  - No space around parentheses:
      push(@array, $scalar);
  - On nested function calls (print join('', map { $_++ } @somearray)) 
    parentheses should be applied where applicable, for readability.
  - Uncuddled braces, and lined up with keyword that starts them
    if ($x eq $y) {
      print "Word up, dawg! \n";
    } else {
      ...
    }

  For the most part, I'm pretty anal about code formatting .. Some
  statements like open I will use a space on, for some reason.

  Miscellaneous Notes
  --------------------------------------

  - Though it should be obvious, it must be noted that the MUD runs quite a bit
    faster with warnings turned OFF. So when putting this up on a server for others
    to use, this should be the thing to do. (Otherwise, if developing the code,
    turn warnings ON ;-)
  - There are two ways of handling client requests, the possibly-better-but-maybe-not
    (i.e., alpha, untested mode) code for it is commented out, and will be tested when
    we get a server to playtest.
  - Command-processing speed: Playing the game solo, and just spamming commands, I've
    counted it processing 14 requests/second. Considering the fact that to count this
    I had to throw a warn statement in handle() that got called on each request (which
    will severely slow the code down) I think it is safe to say that this code is 
    pretty good ;)
