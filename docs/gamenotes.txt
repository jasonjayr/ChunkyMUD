Game Balance Notes (for the Future)
-----------------------------------

* Start off with the four basic classes (fighter, thief, mage, cleric)..
	no races for now.
* Mages will be able to charm monsters + summon elementals by using component
	elemental stones (a la Medievia & EQ)... makes them more effective for soloing
	and also tanking.. they advance slower than warriors, have less hps, etc. The usual..
* Little magic in the game, to the point where mages/clerics are very useful to have around
* Clerics will not be able to charm things, etc..

The most powerful spells will require components to cast, that will be hard to
get.. Spells like summon elemental will summon monsters whose power is relative to the player's level..
