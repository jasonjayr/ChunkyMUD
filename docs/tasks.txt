                THE BIG, NASTY, REPULSIVE, GROTESQUE TASK LIST
                        (and other miscellaneous junk)

  [ At some point, I'll start maintaining this with say, a MySQL database ]

[-- Task List --]
 Types: E = Enhancement, B = Bug, R = Redesign/cleanup
Status: D = Done, W = Waiting, I = Investigating, C = Coding, P = Post-poned

Task "ID"-Type-Status-Priority---Description
    3      E      P      2       Inventory saving/loading code for players - 
																	* Post-poned until INI::Manip finished..
    4      E      W      2       Containers.
    5      E      W      2       Room lighting code (Item Type = "LIGHT")
    7      E      W      3       Better display routine for 'socials'.. Have the output be sorted and generated in nice even columns like 'ls'... 
    8      E      P      3       Code documentation, helpfiles
																 	* Post-poned until further notice
   13      E      W      1       Wizard code (this is another major for v0.07 - see below)
	 18      E	    W      1			 Real logging system
   19	     E	    W      2			 Redo command-processing code so it does not have to do splits, but rather uses substrs to extract the command text
   20	     R	    W      2			 Change it so player names are stored in lowercase EVERYWHERE - however, whenever displayed cosmetically, they are formatted using format_name(). This should've been done this way since day 1.. Currently, it's done the opposite way.
	 23		   E      I      1			 Integrate INI::Manip into the code
	 25      E			W 		 3 			 MOTD code..
	 28      E			W 		 1 			 Add more socials to the game..
	 
   29      ?			? 		 ? 			 Not filled out yet.

Further work
   on v0.07:   1 Complete Wizard privilege code and commands: level, discon, kill, freeze, reload, purge, load, force
                 - Also, CircleMUD-style "asshole control" features.. Such as wizlock, etc. Goes with the above
               1 Real logging system + maintenance utilities for it...
               1 Finish the socials code:
                 - Socials data file, and code that generates socials.pl from the data file
                   (does so at runtime)
                 - Better display routine for 'socials'.. have the output be sorted, and it
                   be generated in nice even columns like 'ls'. see Perl Cookbook for details..
               3 MOTD and IMM-MOTD code.
               3 Retrieve completed socials from Chaos404 ...
               3 Retrieve rooms for Confex FuNhOuSe from sandrews ...
               3 Tons of code documentation (modules, Timer module, how the MUD functions as
                 a whole, all the state codes, various things, etc., plus an index file
                 stating the information that all the documents contain.) .. Regenerate
                 subroutine-list before release, as well.

For v0.08:     - Mobiles/stat code/combat/spells/xp system/armor (Probably in that order)
							 - Player formations (aka groups)
							 - Player positions (sitting, standing, resting, combat... etc.)
               - Shops
               - Editor, news module
               - Player descriptions. Extend 'look' so it can also return player's descriptions.
               - Paging system for looking at text documents.. (sort of like more/less)

For v0.09:     - Zone resets
               - Player aliases?
               - notes system, bulletin board code

Documentation To Write:
-----------------------
   * Basic code documentation (doc/code.txt)
   * Terminology notes - hard links, soft links, zones, rooms, emotes, socials
   * Installation instructions.
   * Incredibly extensive help files. (super-cross-referenced, one for each command, etc.)
      - Should hack together a script to help with this process..
        It should probably read some sort of simple XML markup file...

   Known Bugs/Problems:
   --------------------
   - Connecting to the MUD, not logging in at all, and then disconnecting
     causes the game to attempt to save your character, which doesn't work,
     because you have not entered a username. It shouldn't even attempt this
     anyway.
   - Does deleting the passwd file and then starting up the Chunkster and
     creating characters still prevent their user/pw combo's from being saved?
