Documentation on state table codes:
-----------------------------------
(null)   - Login (enter username)
  1      - Username entered, password waiting to be entered
  2      - Command interpreter
register# - Kludgy way to implement registering new users.
            1 - Enter desired username. Game checks to see if username is
                already taken. If it is, you need to re-enter it.
            2 - Enter desired password. (No confirmation yet ;-)
            Game then lets you in. :)
